    <h1>Garlic Bread</h1>
    <img id=img src="../recipes/images_recipe/garlic.jpeg" alt="image of Garlic Bread"><br>
    <p id=line>There are several methods and twists for making garlic bread, the easiest being just rubbing a cut clove of garlic
         over toasted slices of Italian or French bread, and spreading the toast with olive oil or butter.
        
        
    </p>
    <h3>ingredients:</h3>
    <ul>
        <li>italian Bread</li>
        <li>unsalted butter</li>
        <li>garlic</li>
        <li>fresh parsley</li>
        <li>cheese</li>
    

    </ul>
    <h3>cooking process</h3>
    <ol id =line>
        <li>Preheat oven to 350°F</li>
        <li>Cut the loaf in half, horizontally. Mix the butter, garlic, and parsley together in a small 
            owl. Spread butter mixture over the the two bread halves.</li><br>
        <li>Place on a sturdy baking pan (one that can handle high temperatures, not a cookie sheet) and 
            heat in a 350°F (175°C) oven for 10 minutes.</li><br>
        <li>Remove pan from oven. Sprinkle Parmesan cheese over bread if you want. Return to oven on the highest rack.

            Broil on high heat for 2-3 minutes until the edges of the bread begin to toast and the cheese (if you are using 
            cheese) bubbles. Watch very carefully while broiling. The bread can easily go from un-toasted to burnt.
            
        </li><br>
        <li>Remove from oven, let cool a minute. Remove from pan and use a bread knife to cut into 1-inch thick slices. Serve
             immediately.</li><br>
        
    </ol>
